# Kubernetes JSON Schemas

This repository contains a set of schemas for most recent Kubernetes
versions. For each specified Kubernetes versions you should find four
different flavours:

* vX.Y.Z - URL referenced based on the specified GitHub repository
* vX.Y.Z-standalone - de-referenced schemas, more useful as standalone documents
* vX.Y.Z-local - relative references, useful to avoid the network dependency
* vX.Y.Z-strict - prohibits properties not defined in the schema

Note that the Kubernetes API allows additional properties to be submitted,
but `kubectl` acts like the strict flavour above.

## Example

Here are the links to the `deployment` schemas for Kubernetes 1.20.0:

* [v1.20.0/deployment.json](schema/v1.20.0/deployment.json)
* [v1.20.0-standalone/deployment.json](schema/v1.20.0-standalone/deployment.json)
* [v1.20.0-local/deployment.json](schema/v1.20.0-local/deployment.json)
* [v1.20.0-standalone-strict/deployment.json](schema/v1.20.0-standalone-strict/deployment.json)

## Usage

There are lots of use cases for these schemas, they are primarily useful as a
low-level part of other developer workflow tools. But at a most basic level you can
validate a Kubernetes definition.

Here is a very simply example using the Python [jsonschema client](https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema) and an invalid deployment file:

```
$ jsonschema -F "{error.message}" -i hello-nginx.json v1.20.0-standalone/deployment.json
u'template' is a required property
```

## Specific ideas

As noted these schemas have lots of potential uses for development
tools. Here are a few ideas, some of which I've been hacking on:

* Demonstrating using with the more common YAML serialisation
* Testing tools to show your Kubernetes configuration files are valid,
  and against which versions of Kubernetes
* Migration tools to check your config files are still valid against
  master or beta releases
* Integration with code editors, for instance via something like [Schema
  Store](http://schemastore.org/json/)
* Validation of Kubernetes configs generated by higher-level tools, like
  Helm, Ksonnet or Puppet
* Visual tools for crafting Kubernetes configurations
* Tools to show changes between Kubernetes versions

### Kubeval

```
$ kubeval --strict --schema-location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Onemind-Services-LLC/kubernetes-json-schema/master/schema deployment.yaml
PASS - deployment.yaml contains a valid Deployment
```


## Building the schemas yourself

The tooling for generating these schemas is [openapi2jsonschema](https://github.com/garethr/openapi2jsonschema). 
It's not Kubernetes specific and should work with other OpenAPI
APIs too. This should be useful if you're using a pre-release or otherwise
modified version of Kubernetes, or something like OpenShift which extends the
standard APIs with additional types.
