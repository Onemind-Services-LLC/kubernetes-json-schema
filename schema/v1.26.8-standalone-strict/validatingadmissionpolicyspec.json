The value is null for DELETE requests. 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. 'request' - Attributes of the admission request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind.\n\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object. No other metadata properties are accessible.\n\nOnly property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible.
